add runtime checks (asserts) for invarients
error for finds. PlanPerson.find # blow up, vs @organization.plan.plan_person

write checks outside of the normal flow
can keep alternate code flow simple to reduce chance of bug

safe migrations
monkey patch asserts into libraries
tell rails to ignore columns excluded categories (on staging)

sanity checks in test suite that will blow up (some id needs an index)
